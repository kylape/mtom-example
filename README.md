##Simple MTOM Example

This example takes binary data transferred via a MIME attachment and writes it to the filesystem using a random file name.  The included SoapUI project can be used to invoke the endpoint.  Note that you will need to set the attachment in SoapUI to a valid filename.  You will also need to modify the endpoint implementation class to point to a valid path to write the files to.
